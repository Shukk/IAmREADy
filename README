IAmREADy is an occular characters recognition application.
How to use it?
./main 1 {src} launch the image process. it takes the image's path and apply
  noise reduction, otsu and greyscale to the image.
./main 2 {src} {net} {dest} launch the ocr as a demo. (it will show the
  image process and the network process character by character and save 
  it at the destination).
./main 3 {dest} create a new neural network and save its values to the 
  destination.
./main 4 {src} {dest} create an image training training from the image's path 
  and save it to the destination.
./main 5 {net} {data} use a network created before and train it with data from
  a network training result (the fourth choice).
./main 6 {net} {data} apply the forward propagation fonction on the saved data
  that result from a network training or from a created training.
